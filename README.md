# Brazilian Fintech Default Analysis

For this Analysis, I used an Ubuntu OS. If you are willing to run it on your pc, please make sure that you have installed the python and the following libraries (commands considering my Linux Distro, please confirm the correct code for your OS):

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install python3
sudo yum install pip3
sudo yum install pandas
sudo yum install matplotlib
sudo yum install seaborn
```

After installing Python and every necessary package, let's advance to the Analysis archive: brazilian-fintech-default-analysis.ipynb
